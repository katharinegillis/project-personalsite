    "I am a software developer in my thirties, with side gigs in MMO gaming and knitting. I came to the US nearly a decade ago to live with my husband, who is also a software developer (though one who has fallen off the bandwagon and has some phenomenal managerial skills these days). I love coming up with new processes to help with development at work, and coming up with new solutions for our clients.",
    "In the gaming world I tend to switch between Guild Wars 2, World of Warcraft, and Minecraft. I love new story content and dive down the rabbit hole the moment the game developers give me something new to chase.",
    "I also love to knit, a skill taught to me by my mother when I was little. I picked it up again a few years ago and since then have made teddy bears, shawls, and socks, many with my mom making the same patterns alongside. We have oodles of fun poking through all the yarn in the nearby yarn stores and attempting to not buy all the gorgeous colours, failing pretty much every time."

This website is one such project - I used this to learn about Docker, both in development and production settins, and also to get more practice with frontend work with CSS."],
